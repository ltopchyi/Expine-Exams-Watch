Madrid, Spain's central capital, is a city of elegant boulevards and expansive,
manicured parks such as the Buen Retiro. It’s renowned for its rich repositories of European art, 
including the Prado Museum’s works by Goya, Velázquez and other Spanish masters. The heart of old Hapsburg 
Madrid is the portico-lined Plaza Mayor, and nearby is the baroque Royal Palace and Armory, displaying historic 
weaponry.

Madrid lies on the River Manzanares in the centre of both the country and the Community of Madrid 
(which comprises the city of Madrid, its conurbation and extended suburbs and villages); this community 
is bordered by the autonomous communities of Castile and León and Castile-La Mancha. As the capital city 
of Spain, seat of government, and residence of the Spanish monarch, Madrid is also the political, economic 
and cultural centre of the country.[13] The current mayor is Manuela Carmena from the party Ahora Madrid.

The Madrid urban agglomeration has the third-largest GDP[14] in the European Union and its influence in 
politics, education, entertainment, environment, media, fashion, science, culture, and the arts all contribute 
to its status as one of the world's major global cities.[15][16] Madrid is home to two world-famous football clubs, 
Real Madrid and Atlético Madrid. Due to its economic output, high standard of living, and market size, Madrid is 
considered the leading economic hub of the Iberian Peninsula and of Southern Europe.[17][18] It hosts the head offices 
of the vast majority of major Spanish companies, such as Telefónica, IAG or Repsol. Madrid is also the 10th most liveable 
city in the world according to Monocle magazine, in its 2017 index.[19]

Madrid houses the headquarters of the World Tourism Organization (UNWTO), belonging to the United Nations 
Organization (UN), the Ibero-American General Secretariat (SEGIB), the Organization of Ibero-American States 
(OEI), and the Public Interest Oversight Board (PIOB). It also hosts major international regulators and promoters 
of the Spanish language: the Standing Committee of the Association of Spanish Language Academies, headquarters of 
the Royal Spanish Academy (RAE), the Cervantes Institute and the Foundation of Urgent Spanish (Fundéu BBVA). 
Madrid organises fairs such as FITUR,[20] ARCO,[21] SIMO TCI[22] and the Madrid Fashion Week.[23]
