London is the capital and largest city of both England and the United Kingdom, 
as well as the largest city within the European Union.[7][8] Standing on the River
Thames in the south-east of England, at the head of its 50-mile (80 km) estuary leading 
to the North Sea, London has been a major settlement for two millennia. Londinium was founded 
by the Romans.[9] The City of London, London's ancient core − an area of just 1.12 square miles (
2.9 km2) and colloquially known as the Square Mile − retains boundaries that follow closely its medieval
limits.[10][11][12][13][14][note 1] The City of Westminster is also an Inner London borough holding city
status. Greater London is governed by the Mayor of London and the London Assembly.[15][note 2][16]

London is considered to be one of the world's most important global cities[17][18][19] and has been
termed the world's most powerful,[20] most desirable,[21] most influential,[22] most visited,[23] 
most expensive,[24][25] innovative,[26] sustainable,[27] most investment friendly,[28] most popular
for work,[29] and the most vegetarian-friendly[30] city in the world. London exerts a considerable 
impact upon the arts, commerce, education, entertainment, fashion, finance, healthcare, media, professional
services, research and development, tourism and transportation.[31][32] London ranks 26 out of 300 major 
cities for economic performance.[33] It is one of the largest financial centres[34] and has either the fifth or
sixth largest metropolitan area GDP.[note 3][35][36][37][38][39] It is the most-visited city as measured by 
international arrivals[40] and has the busiest city airport system as measured by passenger traffic.[41] It 
is the leading investment destination,[42][43][44][45] hosting more international retailers[46][47] and ultra 
high-net-worth individuals[48][49] than any other city. London's universities form the largest concentration of 
higher education institutes in Europe.[50] In 2012, London became the first city to have hosted three modern Summer 
Olympic Games.[51]
